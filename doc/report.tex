\section{Program description} % (fold)
\label{sec:program_description}
The \texttt{Python} program contains a set of classes designed to describe and solve power flow problems. The classes are contained in the file \texttt{pf\_classes.py}. The class \texttt{PowerSystem} describes the buses, lines, and transformers making up a power system. Transformers and lines are both described by the class \texttt{Line}, which contains info on series impedance, $R+iX$, and shunt susceptance, $B$, equally divided between the two ends of the line. The class \texttt{Bus} is designed to represent buses in the system. The attributes represented are voltage amplitude $|V|$, voltage angle $\delta$, generated real and reactive power $P_g$ and $Q_g$, real and reactive load $P_l$ and $Q_l$, minimum and maximum generated reactive power (currently not used in calculations) $Q_{g,\text{min}}$ and $Q_{g,\text{max}}$, as well as information on whether the bus is a slack bus, a voltage controlled bus, or neither.

In order to solve the power flow problem described by an instance of the \texttt{PowerSystem} class, different solution methods are implemented in the subclasses of \texttt{PowerFlowSolver}. The currently implemented methods are: full Newton method (\texttt{Power\-Flow\-Full\-Newton\-Solver}), fast decoupled power flow (\texttt{Power\-Flow\-Fast\-Decoupled\-Solver}), and DC power flow (\texttt{Power\-FlowDCSolver}).

\section{Usage} % (fold)
\label{sec:usage}
An example of usage can be found in the file \texttt{gso\_ex\_6\_9.py} (see Appendix~\ref{app:code}) which solves example 6.9 of \citep{glo2012}. To describe the system, lines, transformers, and buses have to be described, and a \texttt{PowerSystem} object must be created. Then a solver object from a selected solver class can be created (for some solvers, e.g. the full Newton solver, additional parameters such as tolerance and maximum number of iterations should be specified) and its \texttt{solve()} method can then be called.
